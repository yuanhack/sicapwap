UCT - UCI Commend Tool

Uct (UCI Command Tool) is the command line tool used to send uci command
requests to the WTPs. Of course it is executed on the AC machine and interacts
with the AC Interface.

To compile it, just run 'make'.

For further details about how to use it, refer to the document UciCommandTool.pdf
